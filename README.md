# Collapsible Tree

a coding practice implementing collapsible tree without using `d3.js`

## inspiration

the coding practice is following [this](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339083) example created by [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/).

## future work

1. animate the transition
2. use better position algorithm
3. adjust position instead of redraw
